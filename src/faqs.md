# FAQS

## What if I can't come every Saturday?
Mentors are not expected to come every weekend, although advanced absence notification is appreciated to help the team plan.

There are also a lot of different ways to be involved in with CodeYourFuture that do not require attendance at teaching sessions. Please have a look at the [non-coding volunteering tasks](/src/no-coding-volunteering.md) and the [coding volunteering roles](/src/volunteering-roles.md) for further information.

## I don't have experience teaching, can I still help?

## What if I don't know JavaScript?
Although the syllabus is JavaScript heavy, non-JS developers are welcome to join. In the first few months, the focus is on logical thinking, data structures and programming constructs. So, even if you are not a JS developer, you can still take an active part.

Later in the course, the students learn frameworks such as NodeJS, Express, React and MongoDB. Non-JS mentors have said that they found these modules helpful for their own learning.

## What if I don't know programming but want to get involved?
Please get in touch. We need you.

## I have ideas to improve the syllabus, how can I share them?

## I know JavaScript but I am not comfortable with React and Node, can I still join?
